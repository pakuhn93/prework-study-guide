# <Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage>

## Description

- This project was created with the purpose to quickly reference prework notes taken during the prework assignment for The Coding Bootcamp hosted by UCSD. We, the students of The Coding Bootcamp, were provided a means to learning basic web development techniques and using basic web development tools and have incorporated it into this program, which can continue to be used and updated in the future.
- The intent of this project was to provide an environment where we, the students, could experience first-hand what it feels like to be a beginning web developer. Not only did this project help solidify basic web development tools and skills, anyone can now access the notes that I have provided and attempt to understand exactly what I learned.
- The finished project is intended to solve any issues with notetaking and to provide a quick reference to basic web developing tools and skills.
- I learned how to use the GitBash environment, basic HTML skills, basic CSS skills, basic JavaScript skills, and how to host a webpage containing all of the information I have decided to incorporate into this project. Additionally, I learned more abstract skills such as common practice styling techniques in coding, documentation on GitHub, and the formatting of a professional README (this file).

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used as a quick reference to tools and skills that are required for web developers. Personally, I will likely be updating this study guide more once I compile an organized list of common references so that I can quickly snap back to this webpage, instead of my physically handwritten notes, when necessary. 

Additionally, this webpage can be used to establish quick review sessions by opening the Google Chrome DevTools console. There, you will find that a topic will be randomly selected for you to review, if you find yourself unable to pick a topic to start.
